## abstract

The humble Australian koala was listed as an extinct animal in South Australia in the early 1900s, hounded from its home and shot on sight. In the 1930s researchers established colonies on Kangaroo Island to restore numbers, and now the state's populations are all deratives from the colony. In the eastern states of Australia, the koala is listed as endangered as the urban sprawl continues to engulf their natural habitats. On Wednesday, 28 November 2012, you can help monitor the population of koalas in South Australia with our Great Koala Count

## abstract

This dataset contains records of bony fishes and elasmobranchs collected by Reef Life Survey (RLS) divers along 50 m transects on shallow rocky and coral reefs, worldwide. Abundance information is available for all records found within quantitative survey limits (50 x 5 m swathes during a single swim either side of the transect line, each distinguished as a Block), and out-of-survey records are identified as presence-only (Method 0).

## Methods

methodStep: This dataset is compiled from data collected in a combination of collaborative surveys with scientists, targeted RLS field campaigns and ad-hoc local surveys by trained RLS divers at their regular dive sites or when on holidays. Field campaigns involve small groups of divers (usually 4 to 8) undertaking survey dives over a period of four days to two weeks (or occasionally longer) under the direction and supervision of a scientist or experienced survey diver. At the conclusion of each field campaign, one of the RLS organizers or scientists leading the trip collates data from participants and undertakes manual checks of the data. These checks included close scrutiny of species lists, abundances and site details. Evidence in the form of images is usually requested for records of species not seen by the experienced surveyor on the trip, with such evidence essential for divers with less experience in that particular region. Uncertain records or records of new species for regions for which definitive evidence is not available are reduced to the highest taxonomic resolution for which there is confidence (usually genus). For ad-hoc surveys by trained divers outside of group field campaigns, species identification assistance and data transfer occur via email, and all the data checks are made by a scientist in the office before uploading data to the database.

studyExtent: More than 2,500 reef locations across the globe. New data are regularly collected and the dataset frequently updated.

samplingDescription: The RLS global reef fish dataset includes data from more than 2,500 sites, collected using standard RLS survey methods, described in detail in an online methods manual (Reef Life Survey methods manual. http://reeflifesurvey.com/reef-life-survey/about-rls/methods/). Surveys involve underwater visual census (UVC) by SCUBA divers along a 50 m transect line, laid along a depth contour on hard substrate (coral or rocky reef). All fish species observed within 5 m of the transect line were recorded on a waterproof datasheet as divers swim slowly along the line.

Abundance estimates are made by keeping a tally of individuals of less abundant species and, in locations with high fish densities, estimating the number of more abundant species. Abundances of schooling fishes are recorded by counting a subset within the school which is combined with an estimate of the proportion of the total school. In coral reefs with high fish species richness and densities, the order of priority for recording accurately is to first ensure all species observed along transects are included, then tallies of individuals of larger or rare species, then finally estimates of abundance for more common species. Only divers with the most extensive and appropriate experience undertake surveys in diverse coral reefs.

Nearly all fishes observed are identified to species level, with photographs of unknown species taken with an underwater digital camera for later identification using appropriate field guides and consultation with taxonomic experts for the particular group, as necessary. When species level identification is not possible, records are classified at the highest taxonomic resolution possible given the information available and experience of the observer. As of 2015, 1.8% of records in the RLS global reef fish dataset were not at the species level (i.e., are at genus level or higher).

Fishes within 5 m of the line are recorded separately for each side of the transect line, with each side referred to as a ‘block’. Thus, two blocks form a complete transect (also referred to as an individual survey). Multiple transects are usually surveyed at each site, usually along different depth contours. Sites are distinguished by unique site codes with latitude and longitude recorded in decimal degrees (WGS84) using a handheld GPS unit, or taken from Google Earth.

## Project

## abstract

Reef Life Survey (RLS) aims to improve biodiversity conservation and the sustainable management of marine resources by coordinating surveys of rocky and coral reefs using scientific methods. RLS activities depend on the skills of experienced and motivated recreational SCUBA divers and partnerships with management agencies and university researchers.

## funding

RLS activities are presently funded primarily through grants from biodiversity management agencies and philanthropic organisations, and with in-kind contributions and support from SCUBA charter operators and shops. Further funding sources and sustainable funding models are being sought to allow long-term continuation of RLS data collection at larger scales.

## study area description

RLS surveys have been undertaken on shallow rocky and coral reefs in all ocean basins and from the Arctic to the Antarctic.

## design description

As of December 2015, the majority of global data represent once-off surveys designed to fill spatial gaps and provide an extensive coverage of reefs around the world. Time-series data from repeat surveys of particular reef sites as part of a monitoring program has largely been confined to some key locations in Australia. A key goal of RLS is to extend to number of locations at which time-series data are collected, undertaking monitoring in many more countries.

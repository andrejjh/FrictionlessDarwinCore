## abstract

Phytoplankton data, species composition, abundance (cells/l) (SDN:P01: PU00M00Z) and biomass (mg/m3) (SDN:P01: WWBMM00Z) collected at coastal stations located in the 1n.m. Bulgarian Black Sea area and stations on a coastal-open sea transects in the  Bulgarian Black Sea region, including the EEZ.

## Methods

methodStep: Phytoplankton samples (1000 ml water sample) were fixed on board in 4% formaldehyde solution, buffered to pH 8-8.2 with disodiumtetraborate. Only  samples integrated for the surface homogenious layer ( 0m - down to the thermocline) were analysed.
In the laboratory the samples are concentrated down to 50 cm3 by slow decantation after storage for at least 20 days in a cool and dark place.
Taxonomic identification and cell counts are done under inverted microscope (Nikon T300E) connected to a video-interactive image analysis system (L.U.C.I.A, Version 4.8, Laboratory Imaging Ltd, Prague) at 400x magnification by the Uteröhl (1958) method in Sedgwick-Rafter counting chambers. 400 cells are counted from each sample, while rare and large species are checked in the whole counting chamber (Moncheva and Parr, 2005/2015). The individual cell biovolume (V, μm3) is derived through the approximation of the cell shape of each species to the most similar regular solid, calculated by the respective formulas (Edier , 1979; Vadrucci et al., 2007),  averaged over measurement of ten cells from each species. Cell bio-volume is converted to weight (W, ng) following Hatchinson (1967). Taxonomic nomenclature is according to the on-line data-base of World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) http://www.marinespecies.org/ and the Black Sea phytoplankton check-list. The QC/QA of the data is performed following the quality control Guidelines for phytoplankton (Moncheva, 2010).

studyExtent: Sampling area: Bulgarian Black Sea - coastal stations located in the 1n.m. Bulgarian Black Sea area and stations on coastal-open sea transects in the  Bulgarian Black Sea region, including the EEZ.
Sampling period: 04.10.2007 - 21.09.2016

samplingDescription: Phytoplankton samples were collected by CTD probe (SBE-911)  with attached Niskin bottles at discrete depths, defined according to the in situ  fluorimeter readings (0m - thermocline- deep chlorophyll a maximum), and   1m above the bottom or down to 75 m depth at the deeper stations.

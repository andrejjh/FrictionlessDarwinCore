## abstract

AxIOM is a sample-based dataset (n = 187 samples) documenting occurrences of amphipod crustaceans associated to Posidonia oceanica seagrass meadows from Mediterranean Islands (Corsica, Sardinia). In total, it contains 10720 records of specimens belonging to 72 species spanning 29 families. Samples were collected over different periods 3 consecutive years, both during the day and during the night. A nested hierarchical sampling design was set up, and multiple sampling methods were combined to ensure a holistic view of the taxocenosis. The dataset package is composed of two data files: one describing sampling events, and the other reporting occurrence data of amphipod crustaceans.

## Methods

methodStep: After collection, all samples were sieved on 400 µm nylon mesh to eliminate sediment and fine particulate organic matter. They were subsequently fixed for >24 hours in a formaldehyde solution (4% in 0.22 µm-filtered seawater). Samples were then sorted to isolate amphipods and transfer them to a preservation solution consisting of 70% ethanol in distilled water to which 1% glycerine was added to prevent evaporation. After identification, specimens were stored in this preservation solution in airtight vials.

studyExtent: The dataset 187 sampling events, spanning 3 consecutive years. Sampling took place in two regions: Corsica (Calvi Bay) and Sardinia (Tavolara-Punta Coda Cavallo Marine Protected Area). To acknowledge temporal variation of communities, samples were taken during different periods of the year (November, March, June, July, August) and during both day and night. Sampling stations encompass various levels of environmental protection and anthropogenic pressure, including integral reserve, partial reserve, general reserve , unprotected pristine zone and heavily impacted zone.

samplingDescription: All sampling was performed by SCUBA diving at depths ranging from 10.4 to 15 metres. 4 complementary methods were used: hand-towed net, litter collection, air-lift and 2 slightly different types of light traps. In both investigated regions, a nested hierarchical sampling design was setup to fully capture the spatial variability of amphipod community structure over multiple scales spanning four orders of magnitude (1 to 1000 metres).

## abstract

The AxIOM dataset was generated during two doctoral research programmes that took place at University of Liège, Belgium, between 2006 and 2012. 

The first one focused on ecology of amphipod crustaceans from Posidonia oceanica meadows, on their place in the food web and on their role in the ecosystem. The dissertation is available at http://hdl.handle.net/2268/95644. 

The second one focused on the multiscale variability patterns of amphipod assemblages associated to P. oceanica meadows, and their potential responses among different  protection levels. The dissertation is available at http://hdl.handle.net/2268/129454.
